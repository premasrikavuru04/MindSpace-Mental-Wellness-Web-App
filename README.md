Welcome to MindSpace, an interactive web application designed to promote mental well-being through self-reflection, goal setting, and positive habit tracking. Developed as a personal project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, MindSpace offers a user-friendly platform to help individuals monitor their moods, set achievable goals, and build a consistent routine for mental health improvement. Inspired by the need for accessible self-care tools, this project combines engaging visualizations with practical functionalities, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their emotional resilience.

The core of MindSpace lies in its mood tracking feature, powered by a customizable mood wheel. Users can select from emotions like Angry, Sad, Happy, Calm, or Excited by clicking on a dynamic canvas-based wheel (200x200 pixels), which visually represents each mood with distinct colors and emojis. Upon logging a mood, the app triggers a reaction animation, displays the selection on a calendar, and generates a personalized playlist based on the latest mood using embedded YouTube links. This integration not only encourages regular mood logging but also provides tailored relaxation or energizing content, enhancing the user experience with real-time feedback.

Goal setting is another key component, allowing users to add, toggle, and track goals with a progress tracker displayed as a doughnut chart (200x200 pixels). The app calculates completion percentages and offers motivational messages (e.g., "Great progress! You're halfway there!") based on the number of completed goals, fostering a sense of accomplishment. A streak counter tracks consecutive days of activity, unlocking achievements like "7-Day Streak" or "Goal Achiever" when milestones are reached, which are visually represented as badges. This gamification approach motivates users to stay engaged with their mental health journey.

MindSpace also includes a daily challenge system that presents a random task (e.g., "Take a 5-minute walk outside") each day, which users can mark as complete to earn additional achievements. A gratitude journal and a journal history section enable users to record and review positive reflections or personal thoughts, respectively, with timestamps for easy tracking. The meditation timer, set to a default of 5 minutes, automatically updates goal completion if a meditation-related goal exists, adding practicality to the feature set. A calendar view highlights logged moods with color-coded days, while mood insights provide weekly trends and personalized suggestions (e.g., "Try a breathing exercise" for an Angry mood).

Technically, the application leverages local storage to persist user data (moods, goals, journal entries, etc.) across sessions, ensuring a seamless experience without requiring a backend server. The initialization process clears the current user state on load to always present the login modal, enhancing security and usability for first-time users. A "Logout" button resets the session, and a dark mode toggle caters to user preferences, with the state saved in local storage. Data export functionality allows users to download their records as a JSON file, promoting data ownership.

The app’s visual elements are rendered using the HTML5 Canvas API, with a line chart (300x100 pixels) for mood trends over the past seven days and the aforementioned doughnut chart for progress tracking. These visualizations are dynamically updated as users interact with the app, providing an intuitive interface. Error handling and console logging are integrated to debug issues like missing DOM elements, ensuring robustness. The project is styled with custom CSS, including responsive layouts and a .logout-btn class for the logout button, and is tested to run locally via a simple server (e.g., python -m http.server on localhost:8000).

MindSpace is designed to be extensible, with plans for future enhancements like notifications for mood reminders (currently set for 8:00 PM daily) and integration with external APIs for richer playlist options. The code is structured for clarity, with separate functions for each feature (e.g., updateDailyChallenge, drawMoodWheel), making it easy for contributors to modify or expand. This project showcases skills in front-end development, DOM manipulation, canvas rendering, and local storage management, serving as a portfolio piece for web development enthusiasts.

To get started, clone the repository, ensure index.html, styles.css, and script.js are in the same directory, and run a local server. Clear your browser cache or use incognito mode for the first run to see the login modal. Contributions, bug reports, or feature suggestions are welcome—please open an issue or submit a pull request. MindSpace is a testament to the power of simple tools in supporting mental health, and I hope it inspires others to explore this domain further.
